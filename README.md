# CodePoacher
Don't reinvent the wheel. Ashera uses android as it base for creating layouts. Layouting code on android is factored out using a technique known as "code poaching" where reusable code is extracted out from the android java file using java parser and rest of the code is stubbed and ensured that the code does not fail. This technique is powerful as Ashera supports the advanced layouts supported by Android such as Recycler View, Constraint Layout on other platforms such as IOS, Browser and SWT.
